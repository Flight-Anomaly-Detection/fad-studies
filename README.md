# flight-anomaly-detection
Clustering approach to flight data anomaly detection.

## File structure
* The **analyses** folder comprises of analysis for better understanding the data, the problem and the algorithms.
* The **input_flights** folder contains the csv files of the flights used accross this project. These reffer to the files released under the NASA Open Source Agreement (NOSA) with the Multiple Kernel Anomaly Detection (MKAD) Algorithm (https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/opensource/projects/mkad/)
* The benchmark folder contains the results of other anomaly detection algorithms applieds to the flights in **input_flights**.
