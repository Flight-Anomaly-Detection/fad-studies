	abstract = {In order to improve safety in current air carrier operations, there is a growing emphasis on proactive safety management systems. These systems identify and mitigate risks before accidents occur. This thesis develops a new anomaly detection approach using routine operational data to support proactive safety management. The research applies cluster analysis to detect abnormal flights based on Flight Data Recorder (FDR) data. Results from cluster analysis are provided to domain experts to verify operational significance of such anomalies and associated safety hazards. Compared with existing methods, the cluster-based approach is capable of identifying new types of anomalies that were previously unaccounted for. It can help airlines detect early signs of performance deviation, identify safety degradation, deploy predictive maintenance, and train staff accordingly.},
